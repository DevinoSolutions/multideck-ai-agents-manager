"""REAL attention-badge evidence: the actual ``multideck attention`` daemon
rewriting the title badges of REAL OS windows as agent-state records change.

The unit suite drives ``AttentionEngine``/``BadgeRenderer`` against a recording
``FakePlatform`` — it proves the diff logic, never that a state change reaches a
live window's title bar. This tier closes that gap with zero fakes: it launches
a real deck (``python -m multideck --go``), writes agent-state records exactly
as an external writer would (the pinned ``{state, ts, cwd, session_id}`` schema,
cwd canonicalized through the product's own ``agent_state.norm_cwd``), runs the
real detached ``multideck attention -d`` daemon, and then reads each window's
title back through the product's own ``snapshot_windows()`` + ``parse_title`` to
watch the badge appear, advance, and clear.

What the Windows leg proves with zero fakes (win32 only — see the platform note):

* **badge appears.** A ``needs-input`` record for a project makes the daemon
  rewrite that project's window title to ``md:[!] <name>`` — observed on the
  live HWND via ``EnumWindows``/``GetWindowTextW`` (the same snapshot the
  renderer itself uses), parsed by the shipping ``parse_title``.
* **badge advances (transition).** Overwriting the record with ``error`` flips
  the live title to ``md:[x] <name>`` on a subsequent daemon tick.
* **badge clears.** Returning the record to ``working`` (an unbadged state)
  restores the clean ``md:<name>`` title.
* **no cross-talk.** The deck's second window maps to no session; it stays a
  clean ``md:<name>`` throughout every stage above.
* **heartbeat liveness.** While the daemon is alive its ``attention.heartbeat``
  artifact is present and fresh — the same signal ``status`` reads.

Platform boundary (honest, not a gap we hid): title badges + taskbar flash are
Windows-only in the shipping code — ``Platform.supports_attention_signals()``
returns True only on ``WindowsPlatform`` and only it implements
``set_window_title``/``flash_window``. On Linux/macOS the daemon therefore has
no window renderer to run; the POSIX leg proves that REAL guard end-to-end
(``multideck attention -d`` refuses with "badges/flash aren't supported on this
OS" and exits non-zero) and emits a loud ``::warning`` that the live-window
badge proof runs on Windows only. There is no honest Linux/xterm badge to
assert because the product sets no titles there.

Deliberately uncovered (documented, never faked): the taskbar FLASH
(``FlashWindowEx``) is not externally observable, so it is not asserted; the
toast (winotify) and ntfy push channels would hit the OS notification UI / the
network, so they are left OFF (no ``MULTIDECK_NTFY_TOPIC``) and unasserted.

Isolation & safety (hard rails): every child process — the ``--go`` launch and
the ``attention`` daemon alike — gets a redirected HOME (so its
``~/.multideck`` state store / pid / heartbeat / logs and its ``~/.claude``
scans hit ONLY tmp, never the real user's), MULTIDECK_* stripped, and a
uuid-namespaced shim dir prepended to PATH holding a benign ``claude`` that
records argv and exits (the real agent is NEVER invoked; asserted pre-flight).
Every window title / project name / marker is uuid-namespaced. Cleanup kills the
attention daemon by its exact recorded pid and closes exactly the uuid-named
windows this test created — nothing else on the desktop.
