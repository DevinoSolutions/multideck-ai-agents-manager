"""wt cold-broker pin: the product's FIRST-EVER `wt` launch on a fresh machine
must survive the Windows Terminal broker's cold-start path.

The first `wt.exe` invocation on a machine that has never run Windows Terminal
goes through broker/registration startup (package activation, settings
generation) and is materially slower than every warm launch after it. The
launch pipeline's only budget for that is ``settleSeconds`` (default 3) plus
``tiling.RETRY_SECS_EXACT`` (6s of 1s-interval polling) -- if the cold broker
takes longer than that combined ~9s, tiling prints "not found" and gives up on
the window. This test pins, against a REAL cold runner, that a default-timing
``--go`` launch tiles its window without tiling ever giving up.

Coldness is guaranteed by ORDERING, not by the test (a test cannot verify the
broker had never started): the CI job runs this file as its own pytest
invocation as the FIRST step that can possibly spawn `wt` on the fresh
windows-latest VM -- before the main platform sweep, before the psmux install
-- gated on ``MDTEST_WT_COLD=1`` which only that step sets. Locally the gate
is absent, the test skips, and no claim of coldness is ever made on a warm
dev box. (This is the honest pin: "the first wt launch of this VM's life fits
the default settle+retry budget", not "this test made wt cold".)

Timing knobs are deliberately NOT tuned down: the config omits
``settleSeconds``/``launchDelayMs`` so the child runs the shipped defaults --
exactly what a first-run user's cold launch gets.

Isolation mirrors test_real_launch.py: redirected HOME, ``--config`` in
tmp_path, benign ``rem <uuid>`` tool command, uuid-titled window, cleanup
closes exactly that window and kills exactly the marker-tagged cmd.exe.
