"""Doctor-report -> monitor-lab replay planner (pure, import-harmless on POSIX).

``multideck doctor --json`` captures a user's exact monitor topology under the
top-level ``monitors`` key (see ``cli/doctor.py``). This module turns one of
those reports into a :class:`ReplayPlan` the virtual-monitor lab
(``monitor_lab.py``) can materialize, so a bug-report topology can be replayed
on a hosted ``windows-latest`` runner and driven through multideck's real
``--go`` tiling assertions.

Everything here is PURE (no ctypes, no Win32, no driver) so the whole planner
is unit-testable on every OS in the normal gate
(``tests/unit/test_doctor_replay_offline.py``). The live materialization +
real-window assertions live in ``tests/platform/test_doctor_replay.py`` and run
only under the ``monitor_lab`` CI tier.

Physical constraints baked into :func:`plan_replay` (learned in the Wave-1
spike; mirrored from ``monitor_lab.DPI_VALS`` and the ZOO comment in
``test_monitor_lab_tiling.py``):

* parsec-vdd DPI is set through the CCD SetDPI port, which only accepts the
  standard Windows scale steps in :data:`STANDARD_SCALES` -- a report's exact
  ``scale_factor`` is snapped to the nearest step.
* Windows refuses a scale whose *effective* resolution would drop below
  ~1024x768, so e.g. 1280x720 cannot exceed 100%. :func:`plan_replay` caps each
  monitor's scale to what its resolution physically allows.
* The live lab lays displays out left-to-right to the right of the runner's own
  (immovable) primary, so a report's exact origins -- negative-x
  "left-of-primary" monitors especially -- are NOT reproduced positionally in
  the live lab; that origin math is pinned OFFLINE via ``compute_grid`` over the
  parsed monitors instead. Every such divergence is recorded as a deviation, so
  the replay is never a silent approximation.
