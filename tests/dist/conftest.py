"""Session fixtures for the packaged-install (``dist``) tier.

This tier proves the EXACT environment a real ``pip install multideck`` user
gets: a wheel built from *this* source, installed into a PRISTINE venv with NO
extras (only the base deps -- click + pydantic-settings), driven through the
real ``multideck`` console-script entry point as a subprocess.

Every other functional tier runs ``python -m multideck`` from the dev checkout
with the dev deps present, so none of them can catch a runtime module that
quietly imports a dev/optional package, or a packaging regression (missing
entry point, wheel that omits a submodule). This tier is the one that can.

The ``packaged`` fixture is session-scoped: the wheel is built and installed
exactly once, then shared by every ``dist`` test. Child-process isolation
(redirected home, stripped ``MULTIDECK_*``, neutral cwd) is re-implemented per
test file as small ``_child_env`` helpers, matching the tests/e2e convention of
light duplication over a shared-helper refactor.
