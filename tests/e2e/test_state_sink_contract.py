"""REAL out-of-repo agent-state writer contract, driven under real node.

WHY THIS TIER EXISTS
--------------------
``multideck``'s ``watch`` / ``attention`` / ``status`` never poll agents; they
read per-session state records — ``{state, ts, cwd, session_id}`` — that an
OUT-OF-REPO writer drops into ``~/.multideck/state/*.json`` from the agent's
lifecycle hooks. The in-repo ``tests/unit/test_agent_state.py::TestSchemaContract``
pins the shape of what multideck *writes and reads*, but nothing here ever ran
the *real external writer*. This tier closes that gap: it installs the actual
published companion package, drives its actual hook under real node the way
Claude Code does, and checks the result against multideck's real reader
(``multideck.agent_state``, imported — never reimplemented).

WHAT THE REAL WRITER ACTUALLY IS  (read from source, not assumed)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
multideck's docs/comments name the writer ``state-sink.mjs``, shipped by the
``ai-agent-notifier`` npm package (DevinoSolutions), wired by
``npx ai-agent-notifier setup`` as Claude Code ``Notification``/``Stop`` hooks.

Driving the real, pinned package (see ``AINS_VERSION``) surfaced a HEADLINE
FINDING, pinned by this tier so it cannot silently change:

  * There is **no ``state-sink.mjs``** in ``ai-agent-notifier`` — not in
    v1.0.6, not in any published version. ``test_no_state_sink_module`` pins it.
  * The package the docs point at is a **pure notifier**. Its real hook entry
    point is ``src/notify.mjs`` (``hooks/hooks.json`` runs
    ``node .../src/notify.mjs --source claude`` on ``Notification`` and
    ``Stop``). It reads the Claude hook event from stdin JSON
    (``{session_id, cwd, hook_event_name}``), then sends a desktop toast / ntfy
    push / terminal bell. It writes its own dedup lock at
    ``~/.ai-agent-notifier/.lock-<source>`` and **nothing else**.
  * It writes **zero** records to ``~/.multideck/state/``. So a user who wires
    only ``ai-agent-notifier`` (as README "Where agent states come from"
    instructs) gets an EMPTY multideck state store — ``watch`` stays blank.

The real invocation contract this tier reproduces (stdin JSON, per-source
``--source`` arg, per-event mapping) is exactly what ``parse-input.mjs`` /
``hooks.json`` in the installed package define — driven, not guessed.

WHAT THIS TIER ASSERTS (the current, true contract)
---------------------------------------------------
For each realistic Claude hook event (``Stop`` → done/task_complete,
``Notification`` → needs-input, ``SessionStart`` → session_start):

  (1) the real hook actually executed under a fully-redirected HOME — proven by
      its own side effect, the ``~/.ai-agent-notifier/.lock-<source>`` lock; and
  (2) multideck's real reader, pointed at ``<HOME>/.multideck/state`` (exactly
      where a compliant writer would drop records), sees NOTHING —
      ``agent_state.all_states() == []`` and no record file exists.

TRIPWIRE / UPGRADE PATH
-----------------------
This tier pins a *gap*. The day ``ai-agent-notifier`` (or any wired hook) starts
writing multideck state records, assertion (2) flips: ``all_states()`` returns a
record and this test goes RED. That is the signal to promote this tier into a
positive schema-contract test — assert the record lands under the redirected
HOME, parses through ``agent_state`` field-for-field against
``TestSchemaContract``'s ``{state, ts, cwd, session_id}``, and that its state is
in ``agent_state._VALID`` — and to bump ``AINS_VERSION`` to the version that
ships the writer. Do NOT paper over it by adding a fake ``state-sink.mjs``.

ISOLATION
---------
HOME (and on Windows USERPROFILE/HOMEDRIVE/HOMEPATH) is redirected into a
uuid-namespaced tmp dir per event, so the real ``~/.multideck`` and
``~/.claude`` are never touched and each event runs against a clean dedup lock
(``notify.mjs`` self-dedups within 10s per HOME+source). No drivers, no servers,
no display — tmp-dir only. Rides the existing ``end-to-end`` job (node is
preinstalled on every GitHub-hosted runner); skips cleanly where node/npm or the
npm registry are unavailable.
