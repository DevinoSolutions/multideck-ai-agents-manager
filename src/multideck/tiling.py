"""The single window-resolve-and-place helper shared by run_multideck's
launch-path tiling and cli._tile_titles's attach-path tiling (R13 residual --
see audit/stage2/E9.md). Both call sites used to hand-roll their own
snapshot/retry loop with no shared helper; this is now the one place that
logic lives, so a fix here reaches both callers.
