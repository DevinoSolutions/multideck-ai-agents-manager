"""Attention engine + renderers — turns the agent_state store into operator signals.

``agent_state`` receives per-session lifecycle states from agent hooks
(Claude Code hooks, Codex notify). This module is the read side: the engine
polls the store, applies staleness (a "working" record from yesterday is not
working), maps session cwds onto configured project names, sorts by how
urgently each session needs the user, and reports *transitions*. Renderers
turn those into signals: window-title badges and taskbar flashes (via the
platform's attention primitives), Windows toasts (optional winotify extra),
and ntfy pushes (stdlib urllib, topic from MULTIDECK_NTFY_TOPIC).

The engine is pure logic (fake store + fake clock in tests); renderers take
a Platform instance and are tested against recording fakes. A renderer that
raises a non-environmental error crashes the loop on purpose — the loudness
doctrine: a broken daemon must page (log + stale heartbeat in `status`),
never limp silently.
