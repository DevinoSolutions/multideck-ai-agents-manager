"""Agent-neutral session-state store.

A small file-per-session record of what an agent is doing -- ``working``,
``done`` (your turn), ``needs-input`` (blocked on you), ``error``, ``idle`` --
keyed by the session's working directory. Any agent that can emit lifecycle
events (Claude Code via hooks, Codex via its ``notify`` program, ...) writes
here; the session picker reads here. That keeps status detection out of the
terminal (no scraping) and uniform across agent types.

Deliberately dependency-light (stdlib only) so the hook handler that imports it
adds negligible latency to every turn.
