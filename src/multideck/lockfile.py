"""Cross-platform exclusive lockfile — prevents TOCTOU races on daemon startup.

Provides a context manager that acquires an exclusive, non-blocking lock on a
file under ``~/.multideck/``.  On Windows the lock uses ``msvcrt.locking``; on
Unix, ``fcntl.flock``.  The lock is advisory (same as flock), which is fine:
callers are cooperating multideck processes, not adversaries.

The file is created if absent.  The lock is released (and the file closed) on
context-manager exit; deletion is best-effort — on Windows a concurrent opener
may hold the path, so an OSError on unlink is swallowed.
